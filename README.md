##itchat for mathematica

(Possibly deprecated) automated wechat using wx.qq.com, get and send most types of wechat content and process them.
Also attached a chat machine which can remotely calculate Mathematica code through wechat. This chat machine is carefully designed and is almost bullet-proof, and it has memory, can return image, etc. Anyway just super powerful!
